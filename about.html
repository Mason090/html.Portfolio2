<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm just starting my web development journey, and I'm really excited about learning HTML! I'm currently focused on mastering the basics of HTML5 and understanding how to create well-structured and accessible web pages. I'm a dedicated learner and I'm looking forward to applying my new skills to future projects.
